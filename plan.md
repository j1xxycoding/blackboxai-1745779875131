# Telegram Invoice Bot Implementation Plan

## Project Structure
```
telegram-invoice-bot/
├── config/
│   └── config.php         # Configuration file (bot token, etc.)
├── data/
│   └── invoices/          # Directory to store invoice files
├── templates/
│   └── invoice.html       # HTML template for invoices
├── src/
│   ├── Bot.php           # Main bot class
│   ├── Invoice.php       # Invoice generation class
│   └── FileStorage.php   # File storage handling class

```

## Implementation Steps:

  2. Ask for last name
  3. Ask for address
  4. Ask for amount
- Invoice generation and storage
- Send invoice to user

4. Invoice Template

5. File Storage System
